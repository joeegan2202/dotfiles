# Joe's Dotfiles and Arch Bootstrap

### Install Dotfiles
Use the install.sh file to install. Caution:
* Will destroy current dotfiles from the included programs list.
* Must **not** be run with root priviledges.

### Current Dotfiles
These are the current programs supported by my dotfiles:
* NeoVim
* i3 (Window Manager)
* zsh and oh-my-zsh
* polybar
* Xresources
* ranger

### Updating Dotfiles
In order to update the dotfiles, edit the files in the git-managed folders. The 'files' in the .config folder are, in fact, Symlinks to the git-managed files.
The system also comes with a built-in updating script based on systemd. This updater is in the git's top directory, and it must be run as the normal user to properly inject the working directory and user into the systemd Exec script. If the updating stops working, re-run the updater.sh script.

## **!!! (Caution) Package Bootstrapper !!!**
Please, don't expect this to work! I am almost certain that this will fail 100% of the time, because I only know it should work in theory. I haven't gotten a totally successful test yet, but even when I do, there is probably no way that it would work in any other case.

### !!! Installing !!!
Run the `./packages-arch.sh` file, **not** with root. This only works as a non-root user.
Ensure that you choose the `polybar` package, not the `polybar-git` package. Do similarly for `vim-plug`, not `vim-plug-git`.
